The objective of this project is to build a reliability index for each market that will indicates whether it's
better or not to trust its current results way before the actual results. In order to do that the idea is to
compute a value representing the capacity of a group to have a 'consciousness', a value that could predict
a group performance. The value is the 'integrated theory' and the group would be all the participant of a
particular market. After measuring the integrated information of the market's participants we hope to see
a correlation with their performance.
